# Client Management System

  Welcome to the Client Management System project! This system provides a comprehensive solution for managing client data and associated products. Built using Vue 3 and Vite, it offers a modern development environment and efficient performance.

  ## Recommended IDE Setup

  For the best development experience, I recommend using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) along with the Volar extension. Here's how to set it up:

  1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  2. Install [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension from the VSCode marketplace. Make sure to disable Vetur if it's enabled.

  ## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TypeScript

  To ensure TypeScript type support for `.vue` files, I utilize `vue-tsc` instead of the default `tsc` CLI. Additionally, use Volar in your editor to enable TypeScript language service awareness of `.vue` types.

  ## Project Structure

  The project structure is organized as follows:

  - **src/**: Contains the main source code for the project.
    - **components/**: Vue components used throughout the application.
    - **types/**: Custom TypeScript type declarations.
  - **public/**: Static assets such as images and favicon.ico.
  - **dist/**: Output directory for compiled code.

  ## Getting Started

  To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

  1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  2. Navigate to the project directory.
  3. Install dependencies using npm:
  
  - npm install

  ## Development

  ### To start the development server and enable hot-reloading, run: 

  - npm run dev

  ## Building for Production 

  - npm run build

  ## Linting 

  ### Ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards by running ESLint: 

  - npm run lint

  ## Customize Configuration 

  ### For customizing the Vite configuration, refer to the Vite Configuration Reference.

  ### When you're ready to deploy the application, build it for production using:
